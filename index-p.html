    When you use our services, you’re trusting us with your information.
    We understand this is a big responsibility and work hard to protect 
    your information and put you in control.

    This Privacy Policy is meant to help you understand what information we collect,
    why we collect it, and how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.

    GOOGLE TERMS OF SERVICE
    Effective May 22, 2024 | Archived versions | Download PDF

    Country version: Nigeria

    What’s covered in these terms
    We know it’s tempting to skip these Terms of Service, but it’s important to establish what you can expect from us as you use Google services, and what we expect from you.
    These Terms of Service reflect the way Google’s business works, the laws that apply to our company, and certain things we’ve always believed to be true. As a result, these Terms of Service help define Google’s relationship with you as you interact with our services. For example, these terms include the following topic headings:

    What you can expect from us, which describes how we provide and develop our services
    What we expect from you, which establishes certain rules for using our services
    Content in Google services, which describes the intellectual property rights to the content you find in our services — whether that content belongs to you, Google, or others
    In case of problems or disagreements, which describes other legal rights you have, and what to expect in case someone violates these terms
    Understanding these terms is important because, by accessing or using our services, you’re agreeing to these terms.

    Besides these terms, we also publish a Privacy Policy. Although it’s not part of these terms, we encourage you to read it to better understand how you can update, manage, export, and delete your information.

    Terms
    Service provider
    Google services are provided by, and you’re contracting with:

    Google LLC
    organized under the laws of the State of Delaware, USA, and operating under the laws of the USA

    1600 Amphitheatre Parkway
    Mountain View, California 94043
    USA

    Age requirements
    If you’re under the age required to manage your own Google Account, you must have your parent or legal guardian’s permission to use a Google Account. Please have your parent or legal guardian read these terms with you.

    If you’re a parent or legal guardian, and you allow your child to use the services, then these terms apply to you and you’re responsible for your child’s activity on the services.

    Some Google services have additional age requirements as described in their service-specific additional terms and policies.


    Your relationship with Google
    These terms help define the relationship between you and Google. When we speak of “Google,” “we,” “us,” and “our,” we mean Google LLC and its affiliates. Broadly speaking, we give you permission to access and use our services if you agree to follow these terms, which reflect how Google’s business works and how we earn money.

    What you can expect from us
    Provide a broad range of useful services

    We provide a broad range of services that are subject to these terms, including:
    apps and sites (like Search and Maps)
    platforms (like Google Shopping)
    integrated services (like Maps embedded in other companies’ apps or sites)
    devices (like Google Nest and Pixel)
    Many of these services also include content that you can stream or interact with.

    Our services are designed to work together, making it easier for you to move from one activity to the next. For example, if your Calendar event includes an address, you can click on that address and Maps can show you how to get there.

    Develop, improve, and update Google services

    We’re constantly developing new technologies and features to improve our services. For example, we use artificial intelligence and machine learning to provide you with simultaneous translations, and to better detect and block spam and malware. As part of this continual improvement, we sometimes add or remove features and functionalities, increase or decrease limits to our services, and start offering new services or stop offering old ones. When a service requires or includes downloadable or preloaded software, that software sometimes updates automatically on your device once a new version or feature is available. Some services let you adjust your automatic update settings.

    If we make material changes that negatively impact your use of our services or if we stop offering a service, we’ll provide you with reasonable advance notice, except in urgent situations such as preventing abuse, responding to legal requirements, or addressing security and operability issues. We’ll also provide you with an opportunity to export your content from your Google Account using Google Takeout, subject to applicable law and policies.

    What we expect from you
    Follow these terms and service-specific additional terms

    The permission we give you to access and use our services continues as long as you comply with:
    these terms
    service-specific additional terms, which could, for example, include things like additional age requirements
    We also make various policies, help centers, and other resources available to you to answer common questions and to set expectations about using our services. These resources include our Privacy Policy, Copyright Help Center, Safety Center, Transparency Center, and other pages accessible from our policies site. Finally, we may provide specific instructions and warnings within our services – such as dialog boxes that alert you to important information.

    Although we give you permission to use our services, we retain any intellectual property rights we have in the services.

    Respect others

    We want to maintain a respectful environment for everyone, which means you must follow these basic rules of conduct:
    comply with applicable laws, including export control, sanctions, and human trafficking laws
    respect the rights of others, including privacy and intellectual property rights
    don’t abuse or harm others or yourself (or threaten or encourage such abuse or harm) — for example, by misleading, defrauding, illegally impersonating, defaming, bullying, harassing, or stalking others
    Our service-specific additional terms and policies, such as our Generative AI Prohibited Use Policy, provide additional details about appropriate conduct that everyone using those services must follow. If you find that others aren’t following these rules, many of our services allow you to report abuse. If we act on a report of abuse, we also provide the process described in the Taking action in case of problems section.

    Don’t abuse our services
    Most people who access or use our services understand the general rules that keep the internet safe and open. Unfortunately, a small number of people don’t respect those rules, so we’re describing them here to protect our services and users from abuse. In that spirit:

    You must not abuse, harm, interfere with, or disrupt our services or systems — for example, by:
    introducing malware
    spamming, hacking, or bypassing our systems or protective measures
    jailbreaking, adversarial prompting, or prompt injection, except as part of our safety and bug testing programs
    accessing or using our services or content in fraudulent or deceptive ways, such as:
    phishing
    creating fake accounts or content, including fake reviews
    misleading others into thinking that generative AI content was created by a human
    providing services that appear to originate from you (or someone else) when they actually originate from us
    providing services that appear to originate from us when they do not
    using our services (including the content they provide) to violate anyone’s legal rights, such as intellectual property or privacy rights
    reverse engineering our services or underlying technology, such as our machine learning models, to extract trade secrets or other proprietary information, except as allowed by applicable law
    using automated means to access content from any of our services in violation of the machine-readable instructions on our web pages (for example, robots.txt files that disallow crawling, training, or other activities)
    using AI-generated content from our services to develop machine learning models or related AI technology
    hiding or misrepresenting who you are in order to violate these terms
    providing services that encourage others to violate these terms
